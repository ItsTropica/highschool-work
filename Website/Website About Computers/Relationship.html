			<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

			<p2>Hardware is the physical component used for computers. This includes; monitors, motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, PSUs, RAM, and the computer box itself. The function of hardware within a computer system mainly consists of:</p2>
			<br>

			<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
			<li>Keyboard</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The keyboard is used to tell the computer what to do when pressed. This can include; telling it to open programs, adding information to a document, switching between tabs, etc. Companies that make keyboards always adds a windows key for Windows shortcuts or the command key for MacOS shortcuts.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li>Mouse</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The mouse is used to help the computer find what you are trying to do quickly and effectively. The mouse can be used for a variety of things, some of these are; playing video games, highlighting applications or text, opening software/applications.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li>Microphone</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The microphone is used to talk with others online without having to find them in person, some apps that help this be possible include; Teamspeak, Skype and Discord. Output ties in to this as you would need a speaker to be able to hear the input from the microphone.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
			<li>Monitor</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The monitor is used to show what you are doing at any given moment in time, it shows all the inputs you have done with your keyboard and mouse. Monitors come in all different shapes and sizes, as well as a different refresh rate (Hz), with the most common being 60Hz.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li>Headphones</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Headphones are used to hear what you are watching/doing, this is used to watch youtube, presentations, play video games and talk to other people. For people to be able to talk, they would need a microphone to input sound.</p2></li>
			
			</ul><br>

			<li>Printer</li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Printers are used to print out data/information that you have found or have typed, this is used for assignments, databases, and pictures. The main use of printers would be work for school and/or jobs.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
			<h2 id="operating">Operating Systems and Utilities</h2>

			<p2>There are many types of operating systems out today, but the main ones you would hear almost everywhere are Windows, MacOS, Android, Linux, and IOS. The same could be said about utility software though, but that comes to whichever software the user thinks is trustworthy and which ones are not viruses in disguise. Utility software helps analyse, configure, optimize, or maintain a computer. For example, DELL computers have a software called SupportAssist which helps with checking for driver updates, scanning the hardware, cleaning files, tuning the performance, and optimising the network connection.</p2>
			<br>

			<h2 id="designed_software">Off-The-Shelf Applications and Custom Designed Software</h2>

			<p2>There are also computers that are either pre-built or made by the user themselves, if it was prebuilt by a company, that computer would have Windows installed and some utility software made by the company. When computers are prebuilt, they won't have Windows on it, so you would have to connect it to the computer by either a USB, or a DVD to add the software. No matter which computer you get, installing Windows will have pre-installed Microsoft software.</p2>
			<br><br>

			<h1 id="processing">Processing of Software Instructions by Hardware</h1>

			<h2 id="fetch-execute">The Fetch-Execute Cycle</h2>

			<p2>The fetch execute cycle is a mandatory cycle used in all computers, it takes all of the instructions you input via hardware and decodes and executes it within seconds and repeats until there’s no instructions left. This is mandatory as if it weren’t used or didn’t happen, nothing would work when we use our hardware.</p2>

			<br><br>

			<h1 id="running">The Initiation and Running of an Application by the Operating System</h1>

			<h2 id="locate&load">Locate and Load Application</h2>

			<p2>The operating system locates and loads applications by the users inputs from their mouse and keyboard, this is done by either searching the application from the search bar or opening folders and files to find applications.</p2>

			<br>

			<h2 id="hand">Hand Control to Application</h2>

			<p2>Users using mice will find and open applications with ease and efficiency.</p2>

			<br>

			<h2 id="start">Start a Fetch-Execute Cycle for the Application</h2>

			<p2>Applications that are started by the user start the fetch-execute cycle.</p2>
