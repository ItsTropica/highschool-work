			<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

			<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

			<p2>The process within a computer system is very simple, your inputs are given to the CPU which tells all of your hardware what to do and what to put on your screen. Some processes would include deleting or creating things on hard drives, opening an executable, or just starting up the computer.</p2>
			<br>

			<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>

			<p2>The storage inside your computer is used to save everything and anything you want, from databases to pictures of your loved ones. There are many types of storage speeds and space, with the most common one today being 500gb.</p2>
			<br>

			<h2 id="control">Control</h2>

			<p2>Control coordinators the input and outputs and the storage on your computer. For example, if you were to delete something, you clicking or pressing delete will send an input to the computer to delete the item, or if you were moving something onto a USB, you would be outputting the data onto a portable storage device.</p2>
			<br><br>

			<h2 id="purpose">How a Variety of Devices and CPUs Achieve Their Purpose</h2>

			<p2>There are a variety of input, output, storage, and CPU devices, which means each would achieve its purpose more efficiently than the other, but how would do they achieve their purpose? Here are how some devices achieve its purpose:</p2>
			<br><br>

			<li><p2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Keyboards achieve their purpose by being able to help put information into documents with efficiency and ease.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2 id="monitor">Monitor</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Monitors achieve their purpose by projecting valuable information to our screen.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2 id="ssd">SSD</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> SSDs achieve their purpose by storing data and information in a portable storage device.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2 id="cpu">CPU</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> CPUs achieve their purpose as the brain by processing input and output data quickly and effectively with relatively 0 delay.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h2 id="trends1">The Current Trends and Developments in Computer Hardware</h2>

			<p2>Some current trends and developments in computer hardware include; New NVIDIA Graphics cards being released and sold within four seconds and high performing and expensive hardware and software.</p2>
			<br><br>

			<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

			<h2 id="generations">Generations of Programming Languages</h2>

			<p2>Programming languages have come a long way, getting new versions that refine the old one as tighten the security for a user. there are 4 generations so far, these four are:</p2>
			<br><br>

			<li><p2>Machine Code: 1st Generation</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The 1st Generation of Language (1GL) is a grouping of programming languages that were used to program 1st Generation computers. The instructions were given through the front panel switches of these computers, directly to the CPU. No translator was used to build the 1st Generation Language.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Assembly Language: 2nd Generation</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> In the 2nd Generation of Language (2GL), programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL were used. The computers used batch processing and multiprogramming operating systems. The difference of this language from 1GL was that the code could be easily read and written very easily by a human.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Higher-Level Languages (Imperative/Procedural): 3rd Generation</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> The 3rd Generation of Language (3GL) refers to a high-level programming language such as FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal and C. The difference of this language from 2GL was that it was more machine-dependent and programmer-friendly.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Declarative (Non-Procedural) Languages: 4th Generation</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Most 4th Generation Languages (4GL) are non-procedural languages that encourage users and programmers to specify the results they want, while the computer determines the sequence of instructions that will accomplish those results. The difference from 3GL was that it was an attempt to get closer to human language.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h2 id="translation">The Need for Translation</h2>

			<li><p2>Compilations</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Compilations are needed as they help us check and run entire files of code instantly, without this, it could take minutes or even hours for games to start up from the amount of coding they have.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Interpreters</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Interpreters are needed as they help other people from other cultures understand the world around us, they are useful as they provide valuable information that is hard to understand from someone who doesn’t speak a certain language.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h2 id="functions">Functions of Operating Systems</h2>

			<li><p2>Provide Interface to Hardware</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Operating systems manages computer hardware resources and provides common service for application software. The operating system acts as an interface between the hardware and programs requesting I/O.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Provide Interface to User</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Operating systems provides a UI and an environment for the user to interact with the computer. Without the interface, the user wouldn't be able to see what they are doing which would completely defeat the purpose of having a computer system.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Provide Interface to Software Applications</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> System softwares maintains the system resources and gives the path for application software to run.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Control the Concurrent Running of Software Applications</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Concurrency executes multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are server process threads running.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<li><p2>Manage System Resources</p2></li>
			<ul class="dashed">

				<li><p2> Operating systems can run multiple tasks at a time and store hundreds of pieces of data with efficiency and ease. Your memory can affect the speed and amount of tasks you run at a time. The only thing your memory can’t affect, is the hardware you use.</p2></li>

			</ul><br>

			<h2 id="trends2">Current Trends in the Development of Software and Operating Systems</h2>

			<p2>Some current trends in the development of software and operating systems include new browsers and applications that help with computer performance, an example of an application/browser is Opera GX. Opera GX is a “gaming browser for gamers”, the browser contains many features normal browsers don’t, these include; being able to change the amount of ram the browser uses, application extensions (discord, teamspeak, youtube), and other great features. Currently the only real trend for operating systems is Windows which is the base OS.</p2>
